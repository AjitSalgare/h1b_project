3)Which industry(SOC_NAME) has the most number of Data Scientist positions? [certified] (using hive)
Ans:
hive> select soc_name,count(soc_name) as cnt from h1b_final where job_title == 'DATA SCIENTIST' AND case_status == 'CERTIFIED' group by soc_name order by cnt desc;
Query ID = hduser_20171018174038_7563aac8-553c-42c6-9299-4e1f8c78b41d
Total jobs = 2
Launching Job 1 out of 2
Number of reduce tasks not specified. Estimated from input data size: 2
In order to change the average load for a reducer (in bytes):
  set hive.exec.reducers.bytes.per.reducer=<number>
In order to limit the maximum number of reducers:
  set hive.exec.reducers.max=<number>
In order to set a constant number of reducers:
  set mapreduce.job.reduces=<number>
